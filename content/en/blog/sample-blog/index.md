DevOps is often among the tools and tech stacks that organizations use to integrate development and operations teams continuously. However, the DevOps culture revolves around the practice and processes that improve the DevOps lifecycle.

“Adopting DevOps doesn’t start with adopting DevOps tools — it starts with adopting the underlying values of the DevOps community,” Katy Farmer wrote.

Tools such as servers, software, platforms, and applications used in DevOps solutions only aid facilitation and implementation. As the DevOps model evolves and pivots, DevOps technologies that make up the DevOps toolchain should adopt new developments and trends to remain competitive.
